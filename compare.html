    <p>Docker and virtual machines are similar tools, but are not the same thing. Simply put, a virtual machine is a fake physical computer and Docker is a fake operating system. A common goal of virtual machines is to run an operating system, but Docker containers are a more efficient way of accomplishing this. With Docker, running an operating system is as efficient as running a typical program like MS Word. Another difference is portability, docker containers are self contained and can be shared much more easily than VM’s. Finally, the only real advantage of a virtual machine is better security since a VM is more isolated than a container</p>

    <p> Performance wise, Docker containers are lighter than virtual machines. For a VM, an entire OS is needed to run along with the application. With Docker containers, you only need to be running one operating system to run the docker engine and you can run multiple containers with no need to run multiple operating systems. This reduces the hardware load significantly with a much lower RAM, hard disk space and processing power footprint. Boot times are also much faster using docker often only taking a few seconds while VM’s can take minutes to load the OS then load the application. </p>

    <p>Another big difference is portability. To share a VM between platforms is no easy task. Because a virtual operating system is involved there is often compatibility issues when sharing from one platform to another. Docker containers are self-contained so a container made on a Windows desktop can run on a Macbook without issue. Since the files sizes are much smaller with containers, sharing is much faster as well. VM files are usually several gigabytes and need a file sharing service to be shared.</p>

    <p>Lastly, the security is the only major advantage with VM’s over Docker. Since virtual machines are stand alone with their own kernel and security features, malicious software would need much more privileges and generally be much more complex to effect the host OS or other VMs. Since docker utilizes the host OS kernel only, malicious software has less targets to hit and only needs to speak one language. </p>
