    <p>Linux is an open source kernel invented by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and its mascot is a penguin named Tux. This open source kernel has made possible the Linux based operating systems such as Ubuntu and Kali. Linux has become a widely used operating system for development and several other users. Linux has a command terminal at its core which is a very powerful and efficient way of operating it however, it has a steeper learning curve versus a graphical user interface. Learning the basic Linux commands is a powerful tool for anyone who uses Linux regardless if there is a GUI available or not.</p>
    <img src=".\images\tux.jpg" alt="Linux Penguin Tux">
    <p>Basic Linux Commands: </p>
<p><b>1. pwd </b></p>
<p>Finds out the path of the current working directory (folder) you’re in. </p>
    <p><b>2. cd</b></p>
<p>Navigates through directories. cd <folder name> goes to a folder located in your current path. You can also use cd /folder1/folder1.1/destination folder for example. </p>
<p>cd .. (with two dots) to move one directory up</p>
<p>cd to go straight to the home folder</p>
<p>cd- (with a hyphen) to move to your previous directory</p>
<p>Note that Linux folders are case sensitive. </p>

<p><b>3. ls</b></p>
<p>The ls command is used to view the contents of a directory. By default, this command will display the contents of your current working directory. </p>
<p>If you want to see the content of other directories, type ls and then the directory’s path. For example, enter ls /home/username/Documents to view the content of Documents. </p>
<p>There are variations you can use with the ls command: </p>
<p>ls -R will list all the files in the sub-directories as well</p>
<p>ls -a will show the hidden files</p>
<p>ls -al will list the files and directories with detailed information like the permissions, size, owner, etc. </p>

<p><b>4. cat</b></p>
<p>cat (short for concatenate) is one of the most frequently used commands in Linux. It is used to list the contents of a file on the standard output (sdout). To run this command, type cat followed by the file’s name and its extension. For instance: cat file.txt. </p>

<p><b>5. cp</b></p>
Use the cp command to copy files from the current directory to a different directory. For instance, the command cp scenery.jpg /home/username/Pictures would create a copy of scenery.jpg (from your current directory) into the Pictures directory. </p>

<p><b>6. mv</b></p>
<p>The primary use of the mv command is to move files, although it can also be used to rename files.
The arguments in mv are similar to the cp command. You need to type mv, the file’s name, and the destination’s directory. For example: mv file.txt /home/username/Documents.
To rename files, the Linux command is mv oldname.ext newname.ext</p>

<p><b>7. mkdir </b></p>
<p>Use mkdir command to make a new directory — if you type mkdir Music it will create a directory called Music.
</p>
<p><b>8. rmdir </b></p>
<p>If you need to delete a directory, use the rmdir command. However, rmdir only allows you to delete empty directories. </p>

<p><b>9. rm command</b></p>
<p>The rm command is used to delete directories and the contents within them. If you only want to delete the directory — as an alternative to rmdir — use rm -r. </p>
<p>Note: Be very careful with this command and double-check which directory you are in. This will delete everything and there is no undo. </p>

<p><b>10. touch command</b></p>
<p>The touch command allows you to create a blank new file through the Linux command line. As an example, enter touch /home/username/Documents/Web.html to create an HTML file entitled Web under the Documents directory. </p>

<p>The command terminal is also critical in using Docker. You simply type in docker then the docker command after that to utilize it’s functions. I will go over how to log in to docker. </p>
<p>The basic format for logging in is: </p>
<p><i>docker login [OPTIONS] [SERVER]</i> </p>
<style>
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
table.center {
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
</style>
<body>

<table class="center">
  <tr>
    <th>Name, shorthand</th>
    <th>Default	Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>--password , -p</td>
    <td>Password</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>--password-stdin</td>
    <td>Take the password from stdin</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>--username , -u	</td>
    <td>Username</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>For example, to log in to a self-hosted registry you would type in:
<i>docker login localhost:8080</i></p>
